# Year 12 Python — AS91896 (Advanced Programming Techniques)
**VS Code + GitHub Classroom**

This repo has two parts:
1) **Lessons** in `lessons/` (explanations + examples + TODO tasks)
2) **Your final assessment program** in `src/main.py`

## Key rules for this assessment
- ✅ Program runs locally
- ❌ No online ordering (no web frameworks, no APIs)
- ❌ No databases (no SQLite/Firebase/etc.)
- ✅ Store data in your program using lists/dictionaries
- ✅ Demonstrate **at least TWO advanced programming techniques**
- ✅ Complete `docs/TESTING.md` and `docs/VERSION_LOG.md`

## Run a lesson
```bash
python lessons/01_review_core_skills.py
```

## Run your assessment program
```bash
python src/main.py
```

## Folder guide
- `lessons/` — learning files you complete
- `src/main.py` — final program (this is what is marked)
- `docs/` — planning + testing + version log evidence
