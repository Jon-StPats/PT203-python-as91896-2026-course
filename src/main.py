"""
AS91896 Assessment Program (Year 12) — Ordering System

Build a local ordering system program (no online ordering, no database).
You may choose the context (canteen/café/etc.) but requirements stay the same.

Minimum requirements:
- Menu items with prices (stored in a collection)
- User can add multiple items to an order
- Calculate and display total cost
- Clear order summary output
- Robust handling of invalid input (no crashing)
- Use at least TWO advanced programming techniques (see docs/PLANNING.md)
- Testing evidence in docs/TESTING.md
- Version evidence in docs/VERSION_LOG.md

Optional (Excellence extension):
- Tkinter GUI as an interface layer (logic separated from UI)

Start small:
1) Print menu
2) Let user choose items
3) Store selections in an order list
4) Calculate total
5) Add validation
